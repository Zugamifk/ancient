Hello my friend,
What you have found is a most powerful artifact. And extremely dangerous.
I have found its likeness in some of my texts. It is a conduit between worlds, a portal to the ethereal realm of spirits. I believe it has two purposes: to trap spirits and draw them into our world, and for viewing the state of the ethereal realm. 

The device requires a special lens to be used correctly. These lenses, when used normally, will showing the ethereal realm rather than ours. However, when placed in the vessel, its function changes. The vessel will allow a greater view from a bird's eye, and will alow the used to travel all over the world and witness anywhere in the world. It is, in effect, a tool for clairvoyance.

In order to trap and capture spirits, a secondary vessel will be needed. These vessels can be attached tot he side, and much be strong enough to keep the spirit inside.
