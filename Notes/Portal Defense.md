## Summary
Enemies are spawning at the evil kingdom, and moving to the portal shrine. You have to stop them.

### Damage
Damage modeled very discretely, like Bloons.
Basic Enemies die in one hit. Adding extra hit point visually changes an enemy, and so does damaging them.
A 2 hit enemy has leather or chain armor. Hitting them knocked off the armor, turning them into a one hit enemy.
A 3 hit enemy has plated armor, and turns into a 2 hit enemy.
There are different Damage types.
* Normal: hurts almost everyone for 1 damage of the current layer
* Heavy: the only damage that can destroy heavy armor
* Piercing: If it hits heavy armor, destroys the layer under the heavy armor
* Area: destroys up to a maximum number of pieces of armor on the same layer
Armour comes in layers and types. A layer of armor has a number of pieces that are removed to show the damage status.
Armor Types:
* Normal: damaged by any type.
* Heavy: can only be damaged by heavy damage

### Card Types

Path starts as straight. Draw 3 out of 5-7 cards to play per turn. Some cards are Path cards that can extend or redirect the path.
* Influence Cards: increase the area you can build in. Path start is forced to the nearest point outside influence as influence expands.
* Pillage Cards: place a valueable area for enemies. If near enough the current path, the current path will redirect to pass through it. Otherwise, it will influence future paths when redirecting.
* Enemies passingh through pillage area will get stronger, gain armor/treasure
* Defender Cards: Place a building or unit that will fire at enemies and damage them
* Training Cards: Upgrade a placed unit or building
* Resource Cards: place resources that can be collected
* Spell Cards: single actions that can be used at any time
* Temple Cards: Allows you to spend resources to use abilities
* Town Cards: Provides workers, a resource for all buildings
* Resource Gatherers: a building that collects a specific resource
* Enemy Building Cards: buildings that redirect the path. spawn additional enemies on the path.
* Trap Cards: A defender type that, if the path passes through it, damages enemies on a cooldown
