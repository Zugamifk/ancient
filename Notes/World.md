# History
The world of men exists as one among many. Since its creation, the gods, spirits, and demons have fought over it, often cataclysmically. Each of these great clashes has marked the end of an age, when much of the world was destroyed, many gods and demons killed or destroyed, and humanity has had to rebuild itself, reforging its bonds with the spirits and rediscovering the gods who choose to reveal themselves. 

There have been 3 such events, each marking the end of an age of man. It is now the fourth age.

## First Age
The beginning of the first age was marked by the creation of the world, and the first man. The world was created as a barren flat plain with no light, no sun, no wind, no seas, no life. The creator, a nameless god, manifested itself as the first man, and the first to experience this world. It named itself Meat. It named the world Earth. It went mad with loneliness.

In its physical form, Meat found itself unwilling to return to the blind drifting of the Ethereal plane of spirits and gods. It cast its power into the earth, hoping to draw the spirits to the physical realm. When the spirits came, some were able to draw enough energy to manifest themselves. They created the sun, the oceans, the wind, moved the earth to create mountains. More spirits came, creating storms, the moon, the tides, and the seasons.

Powerful spirits in turn attracted weaker spirits, and gave them the energy to manifest themselves. The smallest spirits manifested as the trees, grasses and flowers. Meat liked these, and showed his appreciation by consuming them, releasing the spirits within back to the ethereal realm. It wished to share this experience, and reward the spirits who worked to build the world, and so he created the multitudes of creatures and animals in the world. Like Meat, they too could see and hear and feel the world, and so experience it the way it did.

Meat wanted to share the world with other gods. Some came, taking their own forms. An Elf, a Faerie, a Dryad, a Giant, a Dwarf, an Ogre, a Goblin, an Orc, a Brownie, a Halfling, a Gnome. As the gods came, the lands grew. 

Eventually, Meat grew lonely again. It created men, in its own image, and gave them as vessels to many of the spirits. Unlike animals, the men could communicate, organize and build. They took form the world and build cities, kingdoms and temples. They coupled and made families, creating new generations of men as the first generation grew old and died. The other gods soon followed suite, creating their own multitudes, and so earth was soon filled with many peoples.

The demons began to show interest. They saw the multitudes of spirits and were drawn to them. With them, they brought dreams, inspiration and desire to the spirits. They shaped the land, creating places of great power, beauty, and riches.

Meat and the other gods travelled with their people to these regions, and together the gods, spirits and demons lived for a period of great prosperity. As the cities and kingdoms thrived, they grew, and soon the kingdoms of the gods began to intertwine.
